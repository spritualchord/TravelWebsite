      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
        Nomadix is a social travel planning website that was founded by J.R.
        Johnson in September 2011. The site focuses on "friend-sourced" travel
        planning, where users can tap into their social networks to get
        recommendations from friends, family, and contacts who have visited
        specific destinations.
      </p>

      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        Nomadix's mission revolves around making travel planning more
        personalized, social, and efficient by leveraging the power of social
        networks. The platform aims to simplify the process of trip planning by
        allowing users to get recommendations from their friends and trusted
        contacts who have already visited the destinations they are interested
        in.
      </p>

      <h1>Our Vision</h1>
      <p>
        The platform envisions a world where travel decisions are informed by
        personal connections and trusted recommendations, rather than impersonal
        reviews.
